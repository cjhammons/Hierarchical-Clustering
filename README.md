# Hierarchical-Clustering
This repo is a relic from an AI class I took in Fall of 2016 at Auburn University. The assignment was to take a set of points (located in B.txt) and classify them using a Hierarchical Clustering algorithm. 
Here was my output: [![Image from Gyazo](https://i.gyazo.com/166264f186ab6888f0b7ffddcd709aee.png)](https://gyazo.com/166264f186ab6888f0b7ffddcd709aee)

Red and blue indicate distinct clusters. This was my first time using a plotting library with Java, and I was crunched for time so I never labeled the graph.

### Dear AI Students:
Don't copy my homework, do your own work you lazy bum.
